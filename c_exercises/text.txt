The escape sequences used in string constants are also legal in character constants, so '
'
stands for the value of the newline character, which is 10 in ASCII. You should note carefully
that '
' is a single character, and in expressions is just an integer; on the other hand, '
' is
a string constant that happens to contain only one character. The topic of strings versus
characters is discussed further in Chapter 2.
Exercise 1-8. Write a program to count blanks, tabs, and newlines.
Exercise 1-9. Write a program to copy its input to its output, replacing each string of one or
more blanks by a single blank.
Exercise 1-10. Write a program to copy its input to its output, replacing each tab by 	, each
backspace by , and each backslash by \. This makes tabs and backspaces visible in an
unambiguous way.
