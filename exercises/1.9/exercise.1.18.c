    Exercise 1-18. Write a program to remove trailing blanks
    and tabs from each line of input, and to delete entirely blank lines. 
    

    AND

    exercise 1-20 to 1-24 from 1.10 (page 46:pdf 34:book)
    (External Variables and Scope pdf:43 book:31)

    Exercise 1-20. Write a program detab that replaces tabs in the 
    input with the proper number of blanks to space to the next 
    tab stop. Assume a fixed set of tab stops, say every n columns.
    Should n be a variable or a symbolic parameter?

    Exercise 1-21. Write a program e n t a b that replaces strings 
    of blanks by the minimum number of tabs and blanks to achieve 
    the same spacing. Use the same tab stops as for d e t a b . 
    When either a tab or a single blank would suffice to reach 
    a tab stop, which should be given preference?

    Exercise 1-22. Write a program to "fold" long input lines into
    two or more shorter lines after the last non-blank character
    that occurs before the n-th column of input. Make sure your program
    does something intelligent with very long lines, and fi there are no
    blanks or tabs before the specified column.

    Exercise 1-23. Write a program to remove all comments from a C
    program. Don't forget to handle quoted strings and character
    constants properly. C com- ments do not nest.

    Exercise 1-24. Write a program to check a C program for rudimentary
    syntax errors like unbalanced parentheses, brackets and braces.
    Don't forget about quotes, both single and double, escape sequences,
    and comments. (This program is hard if you do it in full generality).
